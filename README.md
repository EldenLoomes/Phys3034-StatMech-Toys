# Phys3034 StatMech Toys
This repository (will) contain(s) all the demonstration programs I (Elden) have written for the USyd Phys3034 mainstream statistical mechanics course. 

So far, I have included:
 - _Quadratic Fermi_, a set of functions to plot fermion occupation distributions under density of state functions.
